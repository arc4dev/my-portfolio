## Project Overview

This project is my personal website portfolio. It was built using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Sanity and all my heart. It was a fantastic opportunity for me to delve into the basics of Next.js, TypeScript and Sanity(CMS). I enjoyed the process and will be using these technologies more often in the future. I would love to hear any feedback on this project, and if there is any, please contact me!
